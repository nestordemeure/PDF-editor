# PDF Editor Specs

## Goal

A fully online (HTML, CSS, JavaScript) PDF editor that can live in a GitHub page.

It will run on book scans, helping us clean them up.

## Requirements

- Load PDFs (one or more).
- Display all pages.
- Reorder pages.
- Select pages (some or all) for editing.
  - Rotate pages (90 degrees).
  - Split pages down the middle (to split double pages).
  - Delete pages.
- Compress images / PDF.
- Set pages to black and white (no need to save useless color information).
- Save the PDF.
- Undo / redo buttons in case of mistake.

## Notes

- Simple, minimal interface. No out-of-scope functionality.
- Prefer existing libraries/frameworks.
- Use a CSS framework.
